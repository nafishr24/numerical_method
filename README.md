# 🔢 Root-Finding Methods Comparison in Python

This repository contains a **Python program** that implements and compares **seven classical numerical methods** for finding roots of nonlinear equations. The purpose of this project is to analyze and visualize the convergence behavior, error reduction, and execution performance of each method.

## 📘 Overview

Root-finding is a fundamental problem in numerical analysis where the goal is to find the value(s) of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \).  
This project provides an implementation of **seven root-finding algorithms**:

1. **Bisection Method**  
2. **Regula Falsi (False Position) Method**  
3. **Fixed-Point Iteration Method**  
4. **Newton-Raphson Method**  
5. **Secant Method**  
6. **Aitken’s Δ² Acceleration Method**  
7. **Steffensen’s Method**

Each method is implemented with iteration tracking, convergence checking, and visual comparison.

## ⚙️ Features

### 1. **Computation of Roots**
Each of the seven methods can compute the root of a given nonlinear function \( f(x) \) with specified initial guesses and tolerance.

### 2. **Error Convergence Graph**
Displays a **comparison plot of error decay per iteration** for all methods.  
This allows users to visually assess **how fast each algorithm converges** toward the true root.

### 3. **Method Behavior Visualization**
Shows how each method approaches the **exact root** over successive iterations.  
The plot illustrates **the iterative movement of approximations** toward the actual solution.

### 4. **Execution Time Comparison**
A bar chart comparing **execution times** for all methods under identical function and tolerance settings.  
This helps identify which method is the most **computationally efficient**.

## 📊 Example Visualizations

Below are example plots generated by the program:

1. **Error Reduction per Iteration**
   - Compares the convergence speed among methods.

2. **Root Approximation Progress**
   - Displays how each method approaches the exact root step-by-step.

3. **Execution Time Comparison**
   - Summarizes runtime differences between methods.

## 🧮 How It Works

The workflow of the program is as follows:

1. **Define the nonlinear function** \( f(x) \).
2. **Set the initial conditions** (initial guesses, tolerance, maximum iterations).
3. **Run all seven root-finding methods** sequentially.
4. **Store iteration results** (root approximation, error, iteration count, runtime).
5. **Generate plots** to visualize and compare results.
